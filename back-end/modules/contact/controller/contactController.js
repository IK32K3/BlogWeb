/**
 * Placeholder Contact Controller
 */

// This is a placeholder function. 
// You will need to implement the actual logic here to handle contact form submissions.
// This might involve:
// - Accessing the form data (req.body) which should contain name, email, subject, and message.
// - Validating the data further if needed (though basic validation is in validations/contactValidations.js).
// - Sending an email with the contact details.
// - Saving the contact message to a database.
// - Sending a response back to the frontend (e.g., success or error).

exports.sendMessage = (req, res) => {
  console.log('Received contact form submission:', req.body);

  // TODO: Implement actual contact form processing logic here

  // Placeholder success response
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Message received successfully!' });
